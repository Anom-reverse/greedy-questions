# greedy-questions
This repo contains questions and solutions for some greedy problems. I am able to think of solutions in cpp  but not best in terms of time and space complexity. i ask everyone to contribute in different languages with different approaches. Thanks for your contribution.

Rules:-
0. Make your first PR here.
1. Just do not simply copy another person's code in this same repositry(you can get it from other sources).
2. Use different languages to code(make this Repo versatile in terms of languages).
3. Use different approaches and comment space and time complexity on the top of your code.
4. you can also add questions to make it large repo(just follow conventions).
5. follow the convention //greedy-algorithm//question_name(or algorithm)//programming language//coding file.
6. This Repo is open for Hactoberfest.
